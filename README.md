# ASP.NET Web API in ASP.NET Core using OWIN

This sample project demonstrates how you can host ASP.NET Web API in an ASP.NET Core app using the included OWIN support. This setup enables migrating existing ASP.NET Web APIs to ASP.NET Core without having to migrate each controller to the ASP.NET Core patterns for web APIs.

Note that migrating ASP.NET Web API controllers to ASP.NET Core is still recommended for better integration and improved performance.
